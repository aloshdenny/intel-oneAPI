## A Brief of the Prototype:
  The proposed project aims to develop an automated system using deep learning techniques to accurately identify and measure the size of fetal heads in ultrasound images. This will facilitate efficient diagnosis and monitoring of fetal health by determining gestational age, identifying abnormalities, and monitoring fetal growth and development.
